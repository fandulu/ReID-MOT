# ReID-MOT

ReID-MOT is a MOT method that using Re-identification (ReID) feature to dominate the data association. It includes both online and offline settings. In online approach, the appearance feature generated by a ReID model dominates the matching process, while the motion information is cast to adaptive temporal-spatial constraints. In offline approach, by utilizing improved appearance features and whole-dataset global information, fragment tracklets are further connected to complete ones.
