# ReID-MOT

ReID-MOT is an MOT method that using Re-identification (ReID) feature to dominate the data association. It includes both online and offline approaches. In the online approach, the appearance feature generated by a ReID model dominates the matching process, while the motion information is cast to adaptive temporal-spatial constraints. In the offline approach, by utilizing improved appearance features and whole-dataset global information, fragment tracklets are further connected to complete ones.
